Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
<p> I have a B.Tech in Computer Science from St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.</p>
<p>I love building web applications and have worked on projects like Best Eats (a food app) and a To-Do app using React, Tailwind CSS, and JSON Server.</p>
<p> I also developed DeepReality, a deepfake detection project using React and FastAPI, and created a front-end-only clone of the AirTM website using Tailwind CSS.
